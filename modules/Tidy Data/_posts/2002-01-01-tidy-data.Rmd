# What is Tidy Data?


There are many ways in which we can organize data. Some of these ways can make for easy data analysis. Others lead to a lot of frustration. This is where tidy data comes in. Tidy data is a concept from  Hadley Wickham's 2014 paper [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). 

In the framework of tidy data every row is an observation, every column represents variables and every entry into the cells of the data frame are values. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#fig:tidy-structure) sums this up with the following graphic:

In order to work with data in this way all of these feature line up for us. Consider the following datasets:


```
#table1
# A tibble: 6 × 4
      country  year  cases population
       <fctr> <int>  <int>      <int>
1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071
2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360
3      Brazil  1999  37737  172006362
4      Brazil  2000  80488  174504898
5       China  1999 212258 1272915272
6       China  2000 213766 1280428583
```

```
#table2
# A tibble: 12 × 4
       country  year        key      value
        <fctr> <int>     <fctr>      <int>
1  Afghanistan  1999      cases        745
2  Afghanistan  1999 population   19987071
3  Afghanistan  2000      cases       2666
4  Afghanistan  2000 population   20595360
5       Brazil  1999      cases      37737
6       Brazil  1999 population  172006362
7       Brazil  2000      cases      80488
8       Brazil  2000 population  174504898
9        China  1999      cases     212258
10       China  1999 population 1272915272
11       China  2000      cases     213766
12       China  2000 population 1280428583
```
```
#table3
# A tibble: 6 × 3
      country  year              rate
       <fctr> <int>             <chr>
1 Afghanistan  1999      745/19987071
2 Afghanistan  2000     2666/20595360
3      Brazil  1999   37737/172006362
4      Brazil  2000   80488/174504898
5       China  1999 212258/1272915272
6       China  2000 213766/1280428583
```

From these above tables we can see that only Table 1 is actually tidy data. We will consider how we can create tidy data from the other 2 as well as some other examples as we move through this unit.
